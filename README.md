## How to use
At this moment in time you can only explore the map of measurements. By choosing wing length, kipps distance, and mass, dots will appear on the map indicating where birds with similar features to the ones you picked were measured.
Birds shown are +-10 of what was selected for each feature.

The size of the circles are a representation of the bird's range. This is shown as circles, but in real life these are often areas of differing shapes.
The areas of the circles have the same area as that of the birds, but not necessarily the shape.
